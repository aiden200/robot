### **Day 9**

- **PAPER: Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**
  - Should've read this paper before PPO
  - Stochastic Policy
  - Q, V, A
  - "Trust Region" update
  - Theorem of improving the policy
- **Paper Implementation: PPO pt 3**
  - I need to study TRPO better to understand what I need to code.
  - Code located in [here](../code/models/ppo.py)
  - Things left: Environment configuration, loss updates, trajectory generation
